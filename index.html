    <h2>Introductions</h2>
        <p>So my full name is Karl Mandy Holanda Abanis (you can just call me Karl), and I know it's pretty 
            long, but my family and I were born in the Philippines. I'm an only child which means I get all 
            of the attention, nothing is spared, and we all moved to the U.S. in 2007. Anyways, when I was 
            a freshman here at Lewis, I initially enrolled as an Aviation Technology major. Since then I've 
            decided to change due to financial reasons, and now I'm enrolled as an Aviation Administration 
            major with no minors to declare.

    <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
        <p>What I'm hoping to learn from this course is how to make a website exactly how I'm doing typing
            this exact statement. By the looks of it, I'm doing pretty good so far so I can't wait to see
            what lies ahead for me in this class. I'm sure this is only the beginning of the process but by
            learning and honing this brand new skill set, I'm sure I'll be able to use this later on in 
            life.
        </p>
    <h2>My Favorite Hobbies / Activities</h2>
        <p>My favorite include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working on Cars</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Playing <a href="https://ultimatevolleyball.com">Club Volleyball</a></li>
          </ul>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>Here's something I think is pretty cool about me: I can speak three languages fluently, 
            technically four if I include dialects. Anyways, Filipino is my first laguage. The two dialects 
            of the Filipino language I can speak is primarily Waray (spoken at home) and secondarily Tagalog 
            (the most popular dialect). Other than that, I can speak Spanish fluently and I'm sure you could 
            take a guess as to what my third language might be.
